    A labeler for binary classification of genomic windows based on introgression proportions.

    This labeler analyzes genomic tracts to label windows as introgressed or not, based on a specified
    proportion threshold. It operates on genomic data for a specified target population, using phased
    or unphased tracts and considering specified ploidy.

        ----------
        ploidy : int
            Ploidy of the samples, typically 2 for diploid organisms.
        is_phased : bool
            Indicates whether the data should be considered as phased.
        win_len : int
            Length of the window for analysis. Must be greater than 0.
        intro_prop : float
            Proportion threshold for labeling a window as introgressed. Must be between 0 and 1.

        """
        Executes the labeling process by analyzing genomic tracts and labeling
        windows as introgressed or not, based on a specified proportion threshold.

        This method operates on genomic data for a specified target population,
        using either phased or unphased tracts and considering the specified ploidy.
        It labels each window with 1 if the proportion of introgressed tracts within
        the window exceeds the introgression threshold (`intro_prop`), with 0 if
        below the non-introgression threshold (`not_intro_prop`), and with -1 for
        windows that do not meet either condition.

        Parameters
        ----------
        tgt_ind_file : str
            The path to the file containing target individual identifiers. If not
            specified, `tgt_ind_file` from the initialization will be used.
        true_tract_file : str
            The path to the file containing true tracts. This file provides the
            information on introgressed genomic regions. If not specified, `true_tract_file`
            from the initialization will be used.
        rep : int or None, optional
            Used to specify the replicate number for the simulated data.

        Returns
        -------
        list[dict[str, Any]]
            A list of dictionaries containing the label for each samples.
